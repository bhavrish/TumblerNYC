# Lab 2 - *TumbNY*

**TumbNY** is a photo browsing app app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can tab an image to view a larger image in a detail view (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] Add Avatar and Publish Dates (+2pt)
- [x] Zoomable Photo View (+2pt)
- [ ] Infinite Scrolling (+2pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)
I can add infinite scrolling to improve my ap functionality.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What is the difference between a view and a view controller?
2. I could add infinite scrolling to extend my app.
